Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

Project Overview

Project Title: Retail Sales AnalysisLevel: Beginner - IntermediateDatabase: sql_project_1

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those starting their journey in data analysis and wanting to build a solid foundation in SQL.

Objectives

Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.

Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.

Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

Project Structure

1. Database Setup

Database Creation: The project starts by creating a database named sql_project_1.

Table Creation: A table named retail_sales is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

CREATE DATABASE sql_project_1;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS retail_sales;
CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE, 
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT, 
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(30),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT, 
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);

2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

Record Count: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.

Customer Count: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.

Category Count: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.

Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-01':

SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-01';

Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
AND quantity >= 4
AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30';

Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.:

SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales FROM retail_sales GROUP BY category;

Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.:

SELECT gender, AVG(age) AS avg_age FROM retail_sales WHERE category = 'Beauty' GROUP BY gender;

Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.:

SELECT transactions_id, customer_id, age, gender FROM retail_sales WHERE total_sale >= 1000;

Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.:

SELECT category, gender, COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category, total_transactions DESC;

Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out the best selling month in each year:

WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
           EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
           AVG(total_sale) AS avg_total_sale,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY year, month
)
SELECT * FROM MonthlySales WHERE rank = 1;

Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales:

SELECT customer_id, gender, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id, gender
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.:

SELECT customer_id, category, COUNT(total_sale) AS total_purchases
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id, category
ORDER BY customer_id, total_purchases DESC;

Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17):

WITH hourly_sales AS (
    SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift, COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_orders FROM hourly_sales GROUP BY shift;

Key Insights & Findings

Total Sales: 1987 transactions

Unique Customers: 155 customers

Top Product Categories: Electronics, Clothing, Beauty

Best Selling Month: July 2022 (541.34 avg sale), Feb 2023 (535.53 avg sale)

Top Customer Spending: Customer 3 (Male) - 24,895 total sales

Peak Sales Hours: Evening shift had the most transactions (1062 orders)

High Value Transactions: 402 transactions had sales above 1000

Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
